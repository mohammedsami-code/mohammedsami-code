About Me 


Greetings, digital I'm a dedicated IT and Social Sciences student with a laser focus on cybersecurity and its societal impacts. My journey blends cutting-edge tech with deep social insights, aiming to fortify our digital world while understanding its human elements. As a budding cybersecurity enthusiast, I'm constantly exploring the latest in threat intelligence, ethical hacking, and digital forensics. But what truly drives me is the intersection of these technical skills with social psychology, policy-making, and ethical considerations in our increasingly connected world. Whether I'm coding a new security tool, analyzing social engineering tactics, or debating tech ethics, I'm always seeking to push the boundaries of what's possible in cyber-social research. Join me as we navigate the complex, fascinating realm where bits meet behaviors!
